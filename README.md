This is the successor to [Archer](https://github.com/akerl/archer). It bootstraps systems using [Rye](https://github.com/delano/rye), Rick's [Linode API wrapper](https://github.com/rick/linode), and the [keychain gem](https://github.com/fcheung/keychain) After initial bootstrapping, it uses [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) for configuration and continuous management.
